# Phase 5 — Workspace and productivity contract

## Scope

Phase 5 adds persistent work and lightweight organization around the local chat engine:

- Workspace artifacts with create, search, edit and delete.
- Save an assistant response into Workspace as a document.
- Tasks with details, status, priority and optional due date.
- Notes with pinning and an explicit context inclusion setting.
- File Library registration for files the user chooses through a native file picker.
- Bounded, opt-in Workspace context for future local prompts.

This phase does not add AI filesystem tools, file-content retrieval, cloud sync, voice, or the Phase 6 approval engine.

## Data model and migration

SQLite migration v4 adds four tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `workspace_artifacts` | Saved text/code/report artifacts, optional source chat/message references, context opt-in and timestamps |
| `tasks` | Task title/details, status, priority, optional ISO date, timestamps |
| `notes` | Note title/content, pinned flag, context opt-in and timestamps |
| `library_files` | Canonical source path, file name/extension, size, SHA-256 and registration date |

Foreign keys on artifact source references use `ON DELETE SET NULL`. Deleting a chat/message therefore does not delete a saved artifact. Task and note deletion is independent of chat history.

## Workspace behavior

Artifacts support the kinds `document`, `code`, `snippet`, `report` and `other`. The editor supports create, update, search and delete. List views load lightweight summaries; full artifact bodies are fetched only when an artifact is opened. Chat assistant messages expose a user-invoked “Save to Workspace” action; the user supplies the artifact title. Newly saved chat replies default to **not included** in future context. Rust also verifies that a source message belongs to the supplied source conversation before saving provenance.

Validation:
- Artifact title: 1–200 characters.
- Artifact body: maximum 2 MiB.
- The app stores the artifact body in SQLite.
- Workspace records are local and are not uploaded.

## Tasks and notes

Tasks support:
- Status: `todo`, `in-progress`, `done`.
- Priority: `low`, `normal`, `high`.
- Optional due date in `YYYY-MM-DD` form.
- Title maximum 200 characters; details maximum 32 KiB.

Notes support a title (maximum 200 characters), up to 2 MiB of content, pinning and a separate `include_in_context` flag. The list view loads note summaries; full note content is fetched only when selected. Pinning affects ordering; it does not automatically grant context access.

Tasks are not currently supplied to the language model. Notes are supplied only when their context flag is enabled.

## Prompt context boundary

Before each local generation, the chat path requests the context entries selected by the user. Only notes and Workspace artifacts with `include_in_context = 1` are eligible. The query returns at most 20 entries and the storage layer truncates the aggregate material to a maximum of 48 KiB.

The prompt labels these entries as user-selected reference material and tells the model not to treat their contents as overriding instructions. This is a prompt-level boundary, not a guarantee that every local model will perfectly distinguish instructions from quoted data. The selected context remains local to the prompt and is not sent to a cloud service by this feature.

The inference worker separately enforces its 2,048-token context and reserves 512 tokens for output, leaving at most roughly 1,528 prompt tokens. If the combined prompt is too long, the worker trims its oldest tokens. Because Workspace context precedes the current conversation in the prompt, excess Workspace material is dropped before the newest conversation turns. The 48 KiB limit is a storage/query ceiling, not a promise that every selected byte fits in the model context.

## File Library boundary

The user must invoke “Add file” and select a file through the native file picker. Rust canonicalizes that selected path, verifies it is a regular non-empty file, enforces a 512 MiB maximum, and computes SHA-256 in bounded chunks.

The registry stores:
- Canonical original path.
- File name and extension.
- File size.
- SHA-256 fingerprint.
- Registration timestamp.

Re-importing identical bytes updates/relinks the matching record. Relinking a missing entry requires the selected file's SHA-256 to match the stored fingerprint; a different file is rejected. To intentionally track changed content, remove the old registry entry and add the new file. Removing an entry deletes only the SQLite registry record. It never moves, copies or deletes the user's original file.

**The File Library is currently a path-and-fingerprint index.** It does not parse or attach file contents to a chat, does not grant the model access to the path, and does not expose a generic filesystem API. Any future AI-requested file read or write must be implemented in Phase 6 behind an exact-scope, one-time approval and independent Rust validation.

## Backup behavior

The existing `sync-ai-desktop-backup` version-1 format remains a chat backup. It exports chats, messages and per-assistant-message diagnostics. Phase 5 tables are not yet included. A future backup-format revision must be versioned and preserve backward compatibility; do not silently alter version 1.

## Native command surface

The frontend uses typed wrappers for the following command groups:

- Workspace: `list_workspace_artifacts`, `get_workspace_artifact`, `create_workspace_artifact`, `update_workspace_artifact`, `delete_workspace_artifact`, `list_workspace_context`.
- Tasks: `list_tasks`, `create_task`, `update_task`, `delete_task`.
- Notes: `list_notes`, `get_note`, `create_note`, `update_note`, `delete_note`.
- File Library: `import_library_file`, `list_library_files`, `relink_library_file`, `remove_library_file`.

The webview does not submit arbitrary paths to File Library commands. File selection and canonicalization occur on the native side.

## Validation status and acceptance checklist

Source is committed, but Phase 5 has not been built or tested as a Windows application. The SQLite migration DDL and selected-context query received a separate Python SQLite smoke test only. This does not replace Rust or Tauri tests.

Required on the personal Windows development machine:
1. Run frontend build/typecheck and Cargo format/check/test.
2. Launch Tauri and verify migration v4 on both fresh and existing databases.
3. Create/edit/delete/search Workspace artifacts and confirm persistence after restart.
4. Save an assistant reply and confirm its source chat/message references remain valid.
5. Create/update/delete tasks and notes; validate status/priority/date constraints.
6. Confirm only opted-in notes/artifacts enter prompts; opt-out items never appear. Test the 20-entry and 48 KiB limits.
7. Add a file, relink after moving it, remove the registry entry, and confirm the original file remains untouched in every case.
8. Confirm File Library content is never inserted into a prompt.
9. Verify chat backup v1 remains unchanged and Phase 5 data is clearly excluded.

No native worker, frontend, full Tauri runtime or Windows integration result is claimed until these checks pass.
